### Hi! I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at Queen's University!

- I love creating software and I've been doing it for years now. A lot of my side projects focus on personal productivity because I enjoy building productivity software that I can use myself!

- I most recently worked as a Software Developer Intern at Squarepoint Capital where I focused on web applications and data pipelines. My prior internship experience also includes working on REST APIs and technical communication.

- I've built projects before using JavaScript, Python, C# and Java. In doing so I've learned React, Django, and other web technologies. In addition, I have strong data analysis and machine learning skills which I've built up through personal projects and my coursework.

- Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
