### Hi! I'm a third year Computer Science student at Queen's University!

- I love creating software and I've been doing it for years now. A lot of my side projects focus on personal productivity because I enjoy building productivity software that I can use myself!

- I've worked as a Software Developer Intern in the past and I'm looking for roles starting Summer 2023!

- I've built projects before using JavaScript, Python, C# and Java. In doing so I've learned React, Django, and other web technologies.

- I'm currently learning more about AI and data analytics, especially as it relates to NLP (natural language processing).
