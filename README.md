### Hi!

- I currently work as a Software Developer at Squarepoint Capital on the Data Engineering team where I focus on building internal tooling including data pipelines and full-stack web applications. 
- My prior internship experience also includes working on building REST APIs and writing technical communication.

- I've built projects before using JavaScript, Python, C# and Java. In doing so I've learned React, Django, and other web technologies. In addition, I have strong data analysis and machine learning skills which I've built up through personal projects and my coursework.

- Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
